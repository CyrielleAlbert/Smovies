# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is Smovies?

Smovies is a social network for cinephiles. 
Easy to use, the goal is to create a platform where people can create groups of movies (called boards), share it and get movies suggestions based on how other people group movies.

## How can you contribute? 

Right now, Smovies is a free platform and the project was neither sponsored nor paid. So anyone with great ideas is welcome to share it with Cyrielle (Cyriellealbert@yahoo.fr) or even start coding. 
I trully believe that to make a product that works, we would need feedback. 

You can also start using it [here](Thesmovies.netlify.app)


## When is the project gonna be released?
The beta version will be released on February the 2nd, 2021 on productHunt.
